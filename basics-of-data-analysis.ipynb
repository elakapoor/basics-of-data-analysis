default shows only first 5 rows of data frame\n","4. **tail**: by default shows only last 5 rows of data frame\n","5. **shape**: shows the total number of rows, columns in the dataframe\n","6. **info**: shows the datatype of every column in data frame\n","7. **describe**: shows the statistics of the columns in dataframe\n","8. **columns**: display the column name of every column\n","9. **unique**: shows the unique value in a column\n","10. **iloc**: select rows/columns as per the index number\n","11. **loc**: select rows/columns on the basis of name\n","12. **value_counts**: count the total value of each type in a column\n","13. **sort_values**: sort the rows of the dataframe according to the column\n","14. **sort_index**: sort the rows of the dataframe on the basis of
